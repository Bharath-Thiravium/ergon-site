## Technical Implementation Details

### Chart Libraries Used:
- **Chart.js** (CDN): For all interactive charts in ledger module
- **Custom CSS**: For mini charts in stat cards

### Data Processing:
- **PHP Array Functions**: Used `array_filter`, `array_map`, `array_sum` for real-time calculations
- **JSON Encoding**: For passing PHP data to JavaScript charts
- **Date Filtering**: Monthly filtering for "Top Advance Type" stat card

### Responsive Design:
- **Grid Layout**: All stat cards use responsive grid system
- **Mobile Optimization**: Charts adapt to smaller screens
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme across all modules

### Performance Considerations:
- **Client-side Rendering**: Charts render on frontend to reduce server load
- **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only essential data passed to JavaScript
- **Cached Calculations**: Stat card values calculated once per page load
