# Task Cascade Deletion Fix

## Problem Statement

When a task with a follow-up was deleted from the Task module:
- ✅ Task was removed from the **Task module**
- ✅ Task was removed from the **Planner module** (daily_tasks table)
- ❌ **Follow-up details remained visible** in the Follow-Up module (orphaned records)

This caused data inconsistency and orphaned follow-up records that referenced non-existent tasks.

## Root Cause

The `delete()` method in `TasksController.php` only handled deletion from:
1. `daily_tasks` table (Planner module)
2. `tasks` table (Task module)

But **did NOT handle** deletion from:
3. `followups` table (Follow-Up module)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TasksController::delete() Method

**File:** `app/controllers/TasksController.php`

**Changes:**
- Added deletion from `followups` table before deleting the task
- Implemented proper transaction handling
- Added comprehensive logging for audit trail

```php
public function delete($id) {
    $db->beginTransaction();
    
    // Get task info for logging before deletion
    $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT title, assigned_to, assigned_by FROM tasks WHERE id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$id]);
    $taskInfo = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    // Delete from followups table first (cascade delete for linked followups)
    $stmt = $db->prepare("DELETE FROM followups WHERE task_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$id]);
    $followupsDeleted = $stmt->rowCount();
    
    // Delete from daily_tasks (cascade delete for planner entries)
    $stmt = $db->prepare("DELETE FROM daily_tasks WHERE task_id = ? OR original_task_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$id, $id]);
    $plannerEntriesDeleted = $stmt->rowCount();
    
    // Delete from tasks table (main task record)
    $stmt = $db->prepare("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = ?");
    $result = $stmt->execute([$id]);
    
    // Log cascade deletion for audit trail
    if ($result && $taskInfo) {
        error_log("Task cascade deletion completed - Task ID: {$id}, Title: '{$taskInfo['title']}', Followups deleted: {$followupsDeleted}, Planner entries deleted: {$plannerEntriesDeleted}");
    }
    
    $db->commit();
}
```

### 2. Updated Task Model delete() Method

**File:** `app/models/Task.php`

**Changes:**
- Implemented consistent cascade deletion logic
- Added transaction handling
- Ensured all related records are deleted

```php
public function delete($id) {
    $this->conn->beginTransaction();
    
    // Delete from followups table first
    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare("DELETE FROM followups WHERE task_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$id]);
    
    // Delete from daily_tasks
    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare("DELETE FROM daily_tasks WHERE task_id = ? OR original_task_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$id, $id]);
    
    // Delete from tasks table
    $stmt = $this->conn->prepare("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = ?");
    $result = $stmt->execute([$id]);
    
    $this->conn->commit();
    return $result;
}
```

### 3. Database Foreign Key Constraints (Optional)

**File:** `sql/add_cascade_constraints.sql`

For database-level integrity, foreign key constraints can be added:

```sql
-- Add foreign key constraint for followups.task_id -> tasks.id
ALTER TABLE followups 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_followups_task_id 
FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add foreign key constraint for daily_tasks.original_task_id -> tasks.id  
ALTER TABLE daily_tasks 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_daily_tasks_original_task_id 
FOREIGN KEY (original_task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add foreign key constraint for daily_tasks.task_id -> tasks.id
ALTER TABLE daily_tasks 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_daily_tasks_task_id 
FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Deletion Order (Critical)

The deletion must follow this specific order to avoid foreign key violations:

1. **First:** Delete from `followups` table (child records)
2. **Second:** Delete from `daily_tasks` table (child records)
3. **Third:** Delete from `tasks` table (parent record)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Create a task with follow-up enabled
2. Verify the task appears in:
   - Task module (`/ergon-site/tasks`)
   - Follow-Up module (`/ergon-site/contacts/followups`)
   - Planner module (if scheduled)
3. Delete the task from Task module
4. Verify the task is removed from ALL modules:
   - ✅ Task module - task should be gone
   - ✅ Follow-Up module - follow-up should be gone
   - ✅ Planner module - planner entry should be gone

### Automated Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
php debug/test_cascade_deletion.php
```

Expected output:
```
=== Task Cascade Deletion Test ===
✓ Created test task with ID: X
✓ Created test followup with ID: Y
✓ Created test daily_tasks entry with ID: Z
Before deletion - Task: 1, Followup: 1, Daily Task: 1
✓ Cascade deletion completed:
  - Tasks deleted: 1
  - Followups deleted: 1
  - Daily tasks deleted: 1
After deletion - Task: 0, Followup: 0, Daily Task: 0
✅ SUCCESS: Cascade deletion working correctly!
```

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Tables
1. `tasks` - Main task records
2. `followups` - Follow-up records linked to tasks
3. `daily_tasks` - Daily planner entries
4. `task_progress_history` - Task progress history (optional cleanup)
5. `task_history` - Task history logs (optional cleanup)

### Affected Modules
1. **Task Module** - Primary deletion point
2. **Follow-Up Module** - Orphaned records now properly cleaned
3. **Planner Module** - Already handled, now consistent

## Audit Trail

All deletions are logged with:
- Task ID
- Task title
- Number of followups deleted
- Number of planner entries deleted
- Timestamp

Log format:
```
Task cascade deletion completed - Task ID: 123, Title: 'Sample Task', Followups deleted: 2, Planner entries deleted: 1
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the transaction will automatically rollback, ensuring:
- No partial deletions
- Data consistency maintained
- Error logged for debugging

## Future Enhancements

1. Add soft delete functionality (mark as deleted instead of hard delete)
2. Implement restore functionality for accidentally deleted tasks
3. Add user confirmation dialog with cascade deletion warning
4. Create archive table for deleted tasks with all related data

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Delete method updated in TasksController

## Notes

- The solution uses application-level cascade deletion (PHP code)
- Database-level foreign keys are optional but recommended for additional safety
- All deletions are wrapped in transactions for atomicity
- Comprehensive logging ensures audit trail compliance
